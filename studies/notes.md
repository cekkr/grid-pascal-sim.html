- Observing the Sierpiński triangle remember me an important idea: the pattern of this fractal "de facto", reveal "black triangles" where backpropagation can fill unforecastable pattern by a so forecastable structure. More over, observing the Riemann zeta function at pole z=1, that by absurdity, with an high range of levels and making dynamic (and programmable) the interpretation of the graph (with a cartesian projection) it's possible to obtain a similar result starting from Sierpiński patterns. Similarly, viewing the classic graph and altering the values conditioning through a "fourth dimension space distortion", like with relativity physic theory. Try to implement this "Sierpiński to Riemann zeta function at pole z" graph. (done)
- Seen the "Sierpinski-Zeta Preset" implementation, implement also the "dynamic JS-coded graphic cartesian projection" to see the results of riemann-zeta z=1 function in classic 2D (remember: for the function having the complete node object could be important to know every detail about why its value)
